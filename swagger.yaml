    Open AMT Cloud Toolkit supports RPS API methods for domains, CIRA configuration, wireless, profiles, and version information.

    For direct connection to RPS:
    * RPS Format of URI: `{{protocol}}://{{host}}:{{port}}/api/v1/admin/{{RPS API}}`

    * Example URI for Domains: [https://example.site.com:8081/api/v1/admin/domains]()


    When running behind the Kong API proxy, prepend the following prefixes to the URI:

    Kong prefixes:
    * `/rps` for all routes

    For connection through Kong:

    * RPS Format of URI: `{{protocol}}://{{host}}/rps/api/v1/admin/{{RPS API}}`

    * Example URI for Authorize: [https://example.site.com/rps/api/v1/admin/domains]()

        Edits an existing AMT configuration profile.

        The profileName can not be changed.

        **Version must be provided to ensure the correct profile is edited.**
          
        The amtPassword and mebxPassword are stored in a secrets manager and are only used during activation and configuration, respectively, to set these credentials in the AMT device.

        **Warning:** Choosing CIRA or TLS is **highly recommended**. By choosing 'none', an unsecure and unsafe channel is used for communication between the AMT device and MPS and is vulnerable to attacks.  To use neither, set both 'tlsMode' and 'ciraConfigName' to **null**.
